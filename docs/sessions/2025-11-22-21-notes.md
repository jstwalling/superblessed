## What Was Accomplished

Bootstrapped a fresh Next.js 15 project for Superblessed, an AI-powered blessing cards app, configured for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

### Project Setup
- Initialized Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4
- Configured pnpm as package manager
- Set up shadcn/ui (New York style) with `cn()` utility and theme CSS variables
- Created hello world home page and `/api/uptime` health check endpoint

### Cloudflare Workers Integration
- Installed `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter and `wrangler`
- Created `wrangler.jsonc` with nodejs_compat flag
- Auto-generated `open-next.config.ts` with R2 incremental cache

### ESLint Configuration
- Migrated from deprecated `next lint` to ESLint 9 flat config
- Created `eslint.config.mjs` with TypeScript, React, React Hooks, and Next.js plugins
- Removed legacy `eslint-config-next` in favor of native flat config

### Documentation
- Created `CLAUDE.md` with project guidance
- Created `README.md` with setup instructions
- Set up comprehensive `.gitignore`

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Cloudflare Workers over Vercel | User preference for pricing model |
| Tailwind CSS v4 | Latest with `@import 'tailwindcss'` syntax and oklch() colors |
| ESLint 9 flat config | `next lint` deprecated in Next.js 16 |
| pnpm | Recommended for Cloudflare projects |

## Commands Reference

```bash
pnpm dev          # Local dev with Turbopack
pnpm preview      # Build + test on Cloudflare Workers locally
pnpm deploy       # Deploy to Cloudflare
pnpm lint         # ESLint
pnpm type-check   # TypeScript check
```

## Open Items

- **R2 bucket**: Not yet created. Required if using ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) features
- **Cloudflare auth**: Need to run `wrangler login` before first deploy
- **shadcn components**: None installed yet, ready via `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]`

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── api/uptime/route.ts   # Health check
│   ├── layout.tsx            # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx              # Home page
│   └── globals.css           # Tailwind + theme
├── components/ui/            # shadcn components (empty)
├── lib/utils.ts              # cn() helper
└── hooks/                    # Custom hooks (empty)
```

## Notes

- ISR caching explained: Next.js feature for updating static pages post-deploy without full rebuild. R2 storage needed on Cloudflare Workers since workers are stateless.
- `pnpm run` is optional with pnpm (unlike npm where it's required for custom scripts)
